# Illusions are strong here.
# It is difficult to tell what is a doorway and what is an object.
#
# The magic spell you use to look can be augmented.
#
# From now on, cast your spell like this:
#
# ls -F
#
# Directories (the rooms of these catacombs) end with a / symbol.
#
# Encounters (programs) end with a * symbol.
#
# You can avoid having to type `ls -F` every time by running the
# following:
#
# alias ls='ls -F'
#
# This is known as a shell or command alias.  With this alias,
# typing simply ls by itself will run ls -F. Try it out!

# You can interact with items in the room (they end with a *)
# by running them as a command (a shell script).
#
# For example, to collect treasure:
#
# ./treasure
#
# The . (dot) means *don't move*, and the name of the
# script makes the code run.  This is known as a
# relative path, and the . means the current room
# (directory).
#
# You may have left treasure in the previous room.
# Go back to a previous directory with two dots,
# which means *take a step back*.
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
# cd ..
